# Challenge 14 Breakdown: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Tech Blog

## Description

The motivation in creating this project was to make an application that allows for users to come together to discuss various coding topics. This application allows for users to create blog posts and comment on created blog posts. 

This project was built in order to demonstrate how code can be modularized based on Model-View-Controller architecture and thus more organized and readable.

This project allows for many users to come together to discuss technical concepts, recent advancements and new technologies

This project reinforced the functionality of the MVC architecture and how it is used to make code more readable. Getting each component of MVC to "talk" to the other in order to create a functioning application was challenging, but after creating this application the concepts were more understandable.

This application has a homepage and a dashboard. The homepage populates blog posts from all users and is accessible to everyone, logged-in users, and users that have not signed up as well. The dashboard tab, however, is only accessible to users who have signed up and logged in correctly. Here in the dashboard, a user has access to all of the blogs they have created themselves. They have the option of adding a new post, and editing or deleting an existing post they have created.
